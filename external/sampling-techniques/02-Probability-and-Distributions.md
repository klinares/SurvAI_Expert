# 2  Probability Distributions

## 2.1 Probability in Sampling

Sampling is the process of selecting a subset of individuals from a population to make inferences about the entire population. It is widely used in statistics, surveys, and research studies to obtain insights without having to analyze every member of the population.

The two primary categories of sampling methods are **probability sampling** and **non-probability sampling**.

## 2.2 Probability vs. Non-Probability

In research and data collection, sampling methods are broadly categorized into probability sampling and non-probability sampling. The choice between these methods depends on the research goals, available resources, and the level of accuracy needed.

### 2.2.1 Probability Sampling

Probability sampling ensures that every element in the population has a known, non-zero chance of being selected. It allows for statistical inference and generalization to the entire population. Common probability sampling methods include:

- ✅ **Simple Random Sampling (SRS)**: Each element in the population has an equal chance of being selected. This can be done using random number generators or lottery methods.
- ✅ **Stratified Sampling**: The population is divided into strata (subgroups) based on certain characteristics (e.g., age, income), and random samples are drawn from each stratum proportionally.
- ✅ **Cluster Sampling**: The population is divided into clusters (e.g., geographic regions), and entire clusters are randomly selected. This is useful for large populations.
- ✅ **Systematic Sampling**: A starting point is randomly chosen, and subsequent selections follow a fixed interval (e.g., selecting every 10th person).

### 2.2.2 Non-Probability Sampling

Non-probability sampling does not guarantee every individual in the population has a chance of being selected. It is often used when probability sampling is impractical or too expensive. Common non-probability sampling methods include:

- ✅ **Convenience Sampling**: Selecting individuals based on availability or accessibility.
- ✅ **Judgmental (Purposive) Sampling**: Selecting individuals based on researcher judgment and expertise.
- ✅ **Quota Sampling**: Ensuring specific subgroups are represented in the sample based on predetermined quotas.
- ✅ **Snowball Sampling**: Participants recruit other participants, often used in hard-to-reach populations.

## 2.3 Types of Sampling Distributions

A **sampling distribution** refers to the probability distribution of a statistic (such as the mean, proportion, variance, or standard deviation) obtained from multiple random samples of the same size from a population. These distributions are essential in inferential statistics, as they help estimate population parameters and test hypotheses.

### 2.3.1 Mean

This distribution consists of the means of all possible random samples of a given size from a population.

**Key Properties:**

- ✅ The mean of the sampling distribution ($\mu_{\bar{x}}$) is equal to the population mean ($\mu$).
- ✅ The standard deviation of the sampling distribution (Standard Error of the Mean, **SEM**) is given by:

$$\sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$

where $\sigma$ is the population standard deviation and $n$ is the sample size.

- ✅ If the population is normally distributed, the sampling distribution is also normal for any $n$.
- ✅ If the population is not normal, the **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** states that the sampling distribution of the mean will be approximately normal if $n \geq 30$.

**Example:** A population has a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. If we take random samples of size 36, the standard error of the mean will be:

$$\sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{15}{\sqrt{36}} = \frac{15}{6} = 2.5$$

If the population follows a normal distribution, the sample means will also follow a normal distribution with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 2.5.

### 2.3.2 Proportion

This distribution describes the possible values of sample proportions from a population.

**Key Properties:**

- ✅ The mean of the sampling distribution of proportions is equal to the population proportion ($p$).
- ✅ The standard deviation (Standard Error of the Proportion, **SEP**) is:

$$\sigma_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{\frac{p(1 - p)}{n}}$$

- ✅ If $np \geq 5$ and $n(1 - p) \geq 5$, the sampling distribution of the proportion is approximately normal (by the normal approximation to the binomial).

**Example:** If 40% ($p = 0.4$) of a population supports a certain policy, and a random sample of 100 is taken:

$$\sigma_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.4(1 - 0.4)}{100}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.24}{100}} = \sqrt{0.0024} \approx 0.049$$

The sample proportions will follow an approximately normal distribution with a mean of 0.4 and a standard deviation of 0.049.

### 2.3.3 Variance

This distribution describes the variability of sample variances.

**Key Properties:**

- ✅ The mean of the sampling distribution of variance is equal to the population variance ($\sigma^2$).
- ✅ The sampling distribution follows a **chi-square distribution** with $(n - 1)$ degrees of freedom.
- ✅ The formula for the sample variance is:

$$s^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}$$

**Example:** If a population has a variance of 25 and a sample size of 10, the sample variances will follow a chi-square distribution with 9 degrees of freedom.

### 2.3.4 Standard Deviation

Since the sample variance follows a chi-square distribution, the standard deviation is derived from it.

**Key Properties:**

- ✅ The sampling distribution of standard deviation does not follow a normal distribution.
- ✅ It is often estimated using the chi-square distribution.

### 2.3.5 Difference Between Two Means

Used when comparing two independent sample means.

**Key Properties:**

- ✅ If $\bar{x}_1$ and $\bar{x}_2$ are the means from two independent samples, the mean of their sampling distribution is:

$$\mu_{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2} = \mu_1 - \mu_2$$

- ✅ he standard deviation (Standard Error) is:

$$\sigma_{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2} = \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}$$

- ✅ If both populations are normal or the sample sizes are large, the distribution of $\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2$ is approximately normal.

**Example:** If two populations have means of 50 and 55 with variances of 16 and 25, and sample sizes of 30 each:

$$\sigma_{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2} = \sqrt{\frac{16}{30} + \frac{25}{30}} = \sqrt{0.533 + 0.833} = \sqrt{1.366} \approx 1.17$$

### 2.3.6 Difference Between Two Proportions

Used when comparing proportions from two independent samples.

**Key Properties:**

- ✅ The mean of the sampling distribution is:

$$\mu_{\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2} = p_1 - p_2$$

- ✅ The standard deviation (Standard Error) is:

$$\sigma_{\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2} = \sqrt{\frac{p_1(1 - p_1)}{n_1} + \frac{p_2(1 - p_2)}{n_2}}$$

- ✅ If sample sizes are large, the distribution is approximately normal.

**Example:** If $p_1 = 0.6$ and $p_2 = 0.5$ with sample sizes of 100 each:

$$\sigma_{\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2} = \sqrt{\frac{0.6(0.4)}{100} + \frac{0.5(0.5)}{100}} = \sqrt{0.0024 + 0.0025} = \sqrt{0.0049} = 0.07$$

### 2.3.7 Student’s t-Distribution

Used when estimating the mean of a normally distributed population with an unknown variance, especially for small samples ($n < 30$).

**Key Properties:**

- ✅ The shape is similar to a normal distribution but has heavier tails (greater variability for small samples).
- ✅ The formula for the **t-statistic** is:

$$t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}}$$

- ✅ Follows a **t-distribution** with $n - 1$ degrees of freedom.

**Example:** If $\bar{x} = 52$, $\mu = 50$, $s = 10$, and $n = 9$, the t-score is:

$$t = \frac{52 - 50}{\frac{10}{\sqrt{9}}} = \frac{2}{\frac{10}{3}} = \frac{2}{3.33} = 0.6$$

Each type of sampling distribution serves a specific purpose in statistical inference, from estimating means and proportions to comparing groups. Understanding these distributions is crucial for hypothesis testing, constructing confidence intervals, and making data-driven decisions.

## 2.4 Standard Normal Distribution

The **Z-distribution** (or **standard normal distribution**) is a normal distribution with a mean of **0** and a standard deviation of **1**. It is used for standardizing data, hypothesis testing, and confidence intervals.

**Key Properties:**

- ✅ The **mean** ($\mu$) is **0** and the **standard deviation** ($\sigma$) is **1**.

- ✅ The **total area** under the curve is **1**.

- ✅ The **Z-score formula** converts raw values into standard normal values:

  

$$Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}$$

where:

- $X$ = observed value  
- $\mu$ = population mean  
- $\sigma$ = population standard deviation

**Empirical Rule (68-95-99.7 Rule)**:

- About **68%** of values fall within **$\pm 1$ standard deviation**.
- About **95%** of values fall within **$\pm 2$ standard deviations**.
- About **99.7%** of values fall within **$\pm 3$ standard deviations**.

**Example:** If a test score is $X = 85$, the population mean is $\mu = 75$, and the standard deviation is $\sigma = 10$, then:

$$Z = \frac{85 - 75}{10} = \frac{10}{10} = 1.0$$

This means the test score is **1 standard deviation above the mean**.

The Z-distribution is widely used in **Z-tests**, probability calculations, and constructing **confidence intervals** for population parameters. 🚀

## 2.5 Central Limit Theorem (CLT)

The **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** states that for a sufficiently large sample size (typically $n > 30$), the sampling distribution of the mean will be approximately normal, regardless of the original population distribution.

Implications of CLT:

- ✅ Allows normal approximation even for skewed population distributions.
- ✅ Enables hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimation using normal-based methods.

## 2.6 Law of Large Numbers

The **Law of Large Numbers (LLN)** states that as the sample size increases, the sample mean approaches the population mean.

- ✅ **Weak Law of Large Numbers**: The probability that the sample mean deviates significantly from the population mean decreases as sample size increases.
- ✅ **Strong Law of Large Numbers**: The sample mean converges almost surely to the population mean as the sample size grows.

## 2.7 Confidence Intervals

A **Confidence Interval (CI)** provides a range of values that likely contain the true population parameter. The formula for a confidence interval for a population mean is:

$$CI = \bar{X} \pm Z_{\alpha/2} \times \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$

where:

- $Z_{\alpha/2}$ is the critical value from the standard normal table.
- $\sigma$ is the population standard deviation.
- $n$ is the sample size.

Common confidence levels:

- **90% CI**: $Z = 1.645$
- **95% CI**: $Z = 1.96$
- **99% CI**: $Z = 2.576$

## 2.8 Hypothesis Testing in Surveys

Hypothesis testing is used to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data. The general steps include:

- ✅ **Define Hypotheses:**
  - Null Hypothesis ($H_0$): Assumes no effect or no difference.
  - Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$): Assumes an effect or difference exists.
- ✅ **Select a Significance Level ($\alpha$)**
  - Common choices: 0.05, 0.01, or 0.10.
- ✅ **Compute the Test Statistic**
  - For mean: $Z = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}$
  - For proportion: $Z = \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)/n}}$
- ✅ **Determine the p-value**
  - If $p < \alpha$, reject $H_0$; otherwise, fail to reject $H_0$.
- ✅ **Draw a Conclusion**
  - If $H_0$ is rejected, there is sufficient evidence to support $H_1$.
  - If $H_0$ is not rejected, there is insufficient evidence to support $H_1$.

Understanding these fundamental statistical concepts allows researchers to design better experiments, analyze survey data effectively, and make informed conclusions based on sampled data.
