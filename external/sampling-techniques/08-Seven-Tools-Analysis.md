# 8  Seven Tools Analysis

## 8.1 Introduction to 7 QC Tools

> Definition: The 7 QC Tools (Seven Quality Control Tools) are simple statistical methods used to systematically identify, analyze, and solve quality-related problems.

## 8.2 What

**What are the 7 QC Tools?**

The **7 QC Tools** are seven simple, statistics-based tools used in quality management to systematically identify, analyze, and resolve problems. Here are the seven tools:

1.  **Check Sheet** – A structured data collection sheet  
2.  **Histogram** – A frequency distribution graph  
3.  **Pareto Chart** – A bar chart based on the 80/20 principle  
4.  **Cause and Effect Diagram (Fishbone/Ishikawa)** – A diagram to trace root causes  
5.  **Scatter Diagram** – A plot showing relationships between two variables  
6.  **Control Chart** – A process monitoring control chart  
7.  **Flowchart** – A visual representation of a process flow

## 8.3 Why

**Why are the 7 QC Tools important?**

- Easy to use by anyone, even those without a statistical background  
- Problem-solving is based on data, not assumptions  
- Improves process efficiency and effectiveness  
- Supports fact-based decision making  
- Enhances product/service quality and customer satisfaction

## 8.4 Who

**Who uses the 7 QC Tools?**

- Quality managers and quality control staff  
- Production operators and supervisors  
- Continuous Improvement / Kaizen teams  
- Internal and external auditors  
- Professionals from various fields: education, healthcare, public services, etc.

## 8.5 Where

**Where are the 7 QC Tools used?**

- Manufacturing industries and factories  
- Hospitals and healthcare services  
- Service and financial companies  
- Educational institutions  
- Government organizations and public services

## 8.6 When

**When are the 7 QC Tools used?**

- When recurring quality issues arise  
- During continuous improvement initiatives  
- When conducting root cause analysis  
- During internal or external quality audits  
- When developing corrective and preventive actions (CAPA)

## 8.7 How

**How to use the 7 QC Tools?**

- Collect data from relevant processes or activities  
- Choose the appropriate QC tool for your analysis goal  
- Visualize the data using one of the 7 tools  
- Analyze data patterns and trends  
- Identify the root cause of the issue  
- Develop solutions and improvement plans  
- Take follow-up action and monitor improvement results

## 8.8 Applied of 7 QC Tools

The application of the 7 QC Tools is highly effective in helping organizations identify and mitigate potential operational risks.

For example, in the context of **delivery delays**, the process can begin with a **Check Sheet** to collect data on dates, times, and reasons for the delays. The gathered data is then analyzed using a **Histogram** to observe frequency distribution patterns, and a **Pareto Chart** to identify the dominant causes that should be prioritized.

Next, a **Fishbone Diagram** (Cause and Effect) can be used to explore root causes based on factors like Man, Machine, Method, Material, and Environment. Once the root causes are identified, a **Scatter Diagram** helps to examine the relationship between key variables—such as the link between order quantity and delay frequency. A **Control Chart** is then used to monitor process stability over time, ensuring variations remain within acceptable limits. Finally, a **Flowchart** is used to map the entire logistics process, helping to pinpoint potential risk areas.

By using the 7 QC Tools, organizations can make data-driven decisions to formulate risk mitigation strategies, such as staff training, regular fleet maintenance, or improving delivery tracking systems. The systematic implementation of the 7 QC Tools not only enhances service quality but also reduces the potential losses due to unmanaged risks.

In operational and logistics management, risks such as delivery delays, data discrepancies, and process errors often arise and affect service quality. To address this, a data-driven approach becomes crucial, and the 7 QC Tools provide the right solution because they can identify, analyze, and help reduce the root causes of these issues systematically.

### 8.8.1 Cheeck Sheet

**Check Sheet** is the first step in identifying a problem. This tool helps gather field data quickly and accurately, especially when we do not yet know the specific problem. In risk mitigation, Check Sheet serves as a tool to **observe and document risk-causing events** systematically.

[TABLE]

#### 8.8.1.1 Check Sheet in R

1.  Data Check Sheet

2.  Frequency Tabulation

```r
# Count frequency of each delay reason
library(dplyr)
library(DT)

reason_summary <- check_sheet %>%
  count(Reason, sort = TRUE) %>%
  rename(Frequency = n)

# Display summary table
datatable(
  reason_summary,
  options = list(
    scrollCollapse = TRUE,
    searching = FALSE,   # Remove search box
    paging = FALSE       # Remove pagination
  ),
  rownames = FALSE,
  caption = htmltools::tags$caption(
    style = 'caption-side: top; text-align: left; 
             font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;',
    'Check Sheet: Summary of Delay Reasons'
  ),
  class = 'stripe hover compact'
)
```

3.  Simple Visualization

```r
library(plotly)

# Interactive bar chart using plotly
plot_ly(reason_summary,
        x = ~Frequency,
        y = ~reorder(Reason, Frequency),
        type = 'bar',
        orientation = 'h',
        marker = list(
          color = ~Frequency,
          colorscale = 'Viridis',  # Can also try: 'Bluered', 'Cividis', 'YlOrRd'
          showscale = TRUE
        )
) %>%
  layout(
    title = list(text = "Check Sheet: Frequency of Delay Reasons", font = list(size = 18)),
    xaxis = list(title = "Frequency"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Reason"),
    margin = list(l = 120)
  )
```

#### 8.8.1.2 Check Sheet in Python

1.  Data Check Sheet

    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    import dash
    from dash import dash_table, html, dcc
    import plotly.express as px
    from datetime import datetime, timedelta

    # Simulate data
    np.random.seed(123)
    dates = pd.date_range(start="2025-04-01", end="2025-04-30")
    delay_reasons = [
        "Bad Weather",
        "Fleet Issues",
        "Road Closure",
        "Schedule Error",
        "Late Departure",
        "Operational Issue",
        "Driver Sick",
        "Sudden Request",
        "Document Error",
        "Technical Disruption"
    ]

    data = {
        "Date": np.random.choice(dates, 100),
        "Reason": np.random.choice(delay_reasons, 100)
    }

    check_sheet = pd.DataFrame(data)

2.  Frequency Tabulation

    # Count frequency of delay reasons
    reason_summary = check_sheet['Reason'].value_counts().reset_index()
    reason_summary.columns = ['Reason', 'Frequency']
    reason_summary

                     Reason  Frequency
    0        Schedule Error         16
    1  Technical Disruption         13
    2          Fleet Issues         13
    3           Driver Sick         13
    4        Document Error         12
    5        Sudden Request         12
    6        Late Departure          6
    7     Operational Issue          5
    8           Bad Weather          5
    9          Road Closure          5

3.  Simple Visualization

    # Create a horizontal bar plot
    fig = px.bar(
        reason_summary.sort_values("Frequency"),
        x="Frequency",
        y="Reason",
        orientation='h',
        title="Check Sheet: Frequency of Delay Reasons",
        color="Frequency",
        color_continuous_scale='Viridis'
    )
    fig.update_layout(margin=dict(l=120), xaxis_title="Frequency", yaxis_title="Reason")

### 8.8.2 Histogram

Once the data is collected, the next step is to present it in a visual format that is easy to understand. A histogram is used to **see how often a problem or risk occurs**, so we can begin recognizing patterns in the events.

[TABLE]

#### 8.8.2.1 Histogram in R

```r
# Install and load necessary libraries
library(plotly)

# Generate normal distribution data (mean = 50, standard deviation = 10)
set.seed(123)
normal_data <- rnorm(1000, mean = 50, sd = 10)  # 1000 random data points

# Calculate the density of the normal data
density_data <- density(normal_data)

# Create a histogram of the normal data using plotly
histogram_plot <- plot_ly(
  x = normal_data,
  type = 'histogram',
  marker = list(color = 'lightblue', line = list(color = 'black', width = 1)),
  name = 'Histogram of Normal Data',
  nbinsx = 30,
  opacity = 0.6,
  showlegend = TRUE
) %>%
  # Add the density curve
  add_trace(
    x = density_data$x, 
    y = density_data$y * length(normal_data) * diff(range(normal_data)) / 30,
    type = 'scatter',
    mode = 'lines',
    name = 'Density Curve',
    line = list(color = 'black', width = 3),
    showlegend = TRUE
  ) %>%
  layout(
    title = 'Histogram of Normal Distribution with Density Curve',
    xaxis = list(title = 'Value', showgrid = FALSE),
    yaxis = list(title = 'Frequency / Density', showgrid = FALSE),
    bargap = 0.1,
    plot_bgcolor = 'white',
    paper_bgcolor = 'white',
    showlegend = TRUE,
    legend = list(
      orientation = 'v',    # vertical legend
      x = 0.98,             # almost at the right edge
      xanchor = 'right',
      y = 0.98,             # almost at the top
      yanchor = 'top',
      bgcolor = 'rgba(255,255,255,0.8)',  # semi-transparent background
      bordercolor = 'black',
      borderwidth = 0.3
    )
  )

# Show the plot
histogram_plot
```

#### 8.8.2.2 Histogram in Python

    import numpy as np
    import plotly.graph_objs as go
    from scipy.stats import gaussian_kde

    # Generate normal distribution data (mean = 50, std = 10)
    np.random.seed(123)
    normal_data = np.random.normal(loc=50, scale=10, size=1000)

    # Calculate density
    density = gaussian_kde(normal_data)
    x_density = np.linspace(min(normal_data), max(normal_data), 500)
    y_density = density(x_density)

    # Scale the density to match histogram frequency scale
    hist_counts, hist_bins = np.histogram(normal_data, bins=30)
    bin_width = hist_bins[1] - hist_bins[0]
    scaling_factor = len(normal_data) * bin_width
    y_density_scaled = y_density * scaling_factor

    # Create histogram trace
    histogram_trace = go.Histogram(
        x=normal_data,
        nbinsx=30,
        name='Histogram of Normal Data',
        marker=dict(color='lightblue', line=dict(color='black', width=1)),
        opacity=0.6
    )

    # Create density curve trace (placed *after* so it appears on top)
    density_trace = go.Scatter(
        x=x_density,
        y=y_density_scaled,
        mode='lines',
        name='Density Curve',
        line=dict(color='black', width=3)
    )

    # Layout
    layout = go.Layout(
        title='Histogram of Normal Distribution with Density Curve',
        xaxis=dict(title='Value', showgrid=False),
        yaxis=dict(title='Frequency / Density', showgrid=False),
        plot_bgcolor='white',
        paper_bgcolor='white',
        bargap=0.1,
        legend=dict(
            orientation='v',
            x=0.98,
            xanchor='right',
            y=0.98,
            yanchor='top',
            bgcolor='rgba(255,255,255,0.8)',
            bordercolor='black',
            borderwidth=0.3
        )
    )

    # Combine traces and show the plot
    fig = go.Figure(data=[histogram_trace, density_trace], layout=layout)
    fig.show()

### 8.8.3 Pareto Chart

**Pareto Chart** is used to identify the main causes of a problem based on the 80/20 principle — that is, 80% of problems are caused by 20% of the causes. This chart combines a bar graph (showing frequency of problems) with a cumulative line graph (showing cumulative percentages), making it easier for users to focus on the most significant causes.

[TABLE]

**Case Example:** A customer service manager records the main reasons for customer complaints over the course of one month.

#### 8.8.3.1 Pareto in R

```r
# Load libraries
library(dplyr)
library(plotly)

# Summarize the number of delays by reason
pareto_data <- check_sheet %>%
  count(Reason, sort = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(
    cum_freq = cumsum(n) / sum(n) * 100  # cumulative percentage
  )

# Create different colors for each Reason
colors <- RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(n = length(pareto_data$Reason), name = "Set3")

# Create Plotly Pareto Chart
fig <- plot_ly()

# Add Bar Chart (Count) - with different colors
fig <- fig %>% add_bars(
  x = ~reorder(pareto_data$Reason, -pareto_data$n),
  y = ~pareto_data$n,
  name = 'Number of Delays',
  marker = list(color = colors),
  yaxis = "y1"
)

# Add Cumulative Line
fig <- fig %>% add_lines(
  x = ~reorder(pareto_data$Reason, -pareto_data$n),
  y = ~pareto_data$cum_freq,
  name = 'Cumulative (%)',
  yaxis = "y2",
  line = list(color = 'red', dash = 'dash')
)

# Add Cut-off Line at 80%
fig <- fig %>% add_lines(
  x = ~reorder(pareto_data$Reason, -pareto_data$n),
  y = rep(80, length(pareto_data$Reason)),
  name = 'Cut-off 80%',
  yaxis = "y2",
  line = list(color = 'green', dash = 'dot')
)

# Adjust layout
fig <- fig %>% layout(
  title = "Pareto Chart - Delay Reasons",
  xaxis = list(
    title = "Delay Reasons",
    tickangle = -45   # tilt 45 degrees
  ),
  yaxis = list(title = "Number of Delays"),
  yaxis2 = list(
    title = "Cumulative (%)",
    overlaying = "y",
    side = "right",
    range = c(0, 100)
  ),
  legend = list(x = 0.8, y = 0.75),
  shapes = list(
    list(
      type = "line",
      x0 = -0.5,
      x1 = length(pareto_data$Reason) - 0.5,
      y0 = 80,
      y1 = 80,
      yref = "y2",
      line = list(color = "green", width = 2, dash = "dot")
    )
  )
)

# Show chart

### 8.8.5 Scatter Diagram

To examine the **relationship between two risk variables**, the Scatter Diagram is an ideal tool. For example, is there a relationship between the number of deliveries and the frequency of delays?

[TABLE]

#### 8.8.5.1 Scatter Diagram in R

```r
# Install the required package if not already installed
# install.packages("plotly")

# Load the plotly package

)

# Introduce some noise to get a correlation of around 0.9
data$Number_of_Delays <- data$Number_of_Delays + rnorm(n = 20, mean = 0, sd = 2)

# Calculate the correlation coefficient between the number of deliveries and the number of delays
